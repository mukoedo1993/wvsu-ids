CORS Solution (Test Cloud Function from Localhost)
Hello everyone, if you'd like to be able to test the Client Area feature from your localhost:3000 preview, simply modify your Cloud Function file named secret-area.js to look like this instead:

exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {
  const headers = {
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" : "*",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Headers" : "Content-Type"
  }
 
  if (event.httpMethod !== "POST") {
    return callback(null, {
      statusCode: 200,
      headers,
      body: "This was not a POST request"
    })
  }
  
  const secretContent = `
  <h3>Welcome To The Secret Area</h3>
  <p>Here we can tell you that the sky is <strong>blue</strong>, and two plus two equals four.</p>
  `
  
  let body
 
  if (event.body) {
    body = JSON.parse(event.body)
  } else {
    body = {}
  }
 
  if (body.password == "javascript") {
    callback(null, {
      statusCode: 200,
      headers,
      body: secretContent
    })
  } else {
    callback(null, {
      statusCode: 401,
      headers
    })
  }
 
  
}
If you'd like to learn more about the topic of CORS I always recommend the Mozilla Developer Network.

The actual solution to this issue is to use Netlify Dev. If you're interested in the Netlify platform it's definitely worth looking into.
